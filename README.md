List Manipulation Assignment
Overview

This assignment demonstrates fundamental list operations in Python. You will practice creating and modifying lists by adding, inserting, extending, removing, sorting elements, and locating the position of an element within the list.

Tasks Completed

Created an empty list named my_list.

Appended elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list.

Inserted the value 15 at the second position (index 1).

Extended the list with [50, 60, 70].

Removed the last element from the list.

Sorted the list in ascending order.

Found and printed the index of the value 30 in the sorted list.

How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).

Save the provided Python code in a file named list_assignment.py.

Run the script using the command:

python list_assignment.py


The program will output the index of the value 30 after all list operations.

Expected Output
4


This output represents the zero-based index position of the value 30 in the final sorted list.

Notes

This assignment focuses on basic list methods such as append(), insert(), extend(), pop(), sort(), and index().

It demonstrates the order of operations and how they affect the list structure.# PYTHON-WEEEK-2
